    DISCLAMER: this is still pre-alpha stuff, so don't build on it (yet)

    L I F E is intended to record events that take place in life.

    this is (in first instance) aimed at people with serious deceases that need to take lots of medicine and who's condition needs to be monitored

    none of that is functional in this release, just trying to get a base running to build upon.   

    i plan to release a new version every week (if all goes well) so be prepared for lots of updates

    " rushed out into the world because i can't wait to register the namespace ;] "

    you can install the package on pypi (provides a "life" program) or run python3 life/__init.py

    TODO: 

        1) unittests for this core
        2) port IRC over from jsonbot
        3) incorporate sleekxmpp as done in jsonbot
        4) port over most plugins
        5) make bots communicate with each other so events can be logged on multiple hosts
        6) make functionality to authenticate logged events with these multiple hosts
        7) make plugins/code to analyse series of events. 
        etc.
